        <h2 id="download">Obtaining the awa5x suite</h2>

        <p>The <em>awa5x</em> suite of tools can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/Stark-Night/awa5x/releases">GitHub repository</a>. Visit the homepage for more details.</p>
        <p>The archive to download has the form: <code>awa5x-[VERSION]-tools-[PLATFORM]-[ARCH].zip</code>.</p>
        <p>On Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; systems, download the archive whose <code>[PLATFORM]</code> component is <i>windows</i>.</p>
        <p>On POSIX&trade; and UNIX&reg;-like systems, download the archive whose <code>[PLATFORM]</code> component is <i>unix</i>.</p>
        <p>If you have particular hardware, please ensure that <code>[ARCH]</code> matches your processor type.</p>

        <p>Once you have downloaded the archive, create a directory and unpack the archive inside it. You might want to call the directory <code>awa5x</code> for simplicity. After unpacking, this directory should contain at least two programs to progress with this tutorial: <i>awa5</i> and <i>awa5c</i>.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="environment">
        <h2 id="environment">Development environment</h2>

        <p>Once you have downloaded the tools, you only need two more programs which are usually provided by your operating system: a text editor and a command-line terminal.</p>
        <p>Usually systems come with a text editor already installed: it can be <i>Notepad</i>, <i>gedit</i> or <i>nano</i>; power users might have other editors installed like <i>Emacs</i>, <i>Vim</i> or <i>ed</i>.</p>
        <p><i>awa5x</i> programs can be written using any editor, as long as the file is in <em>plain text</em>, usually indicated with the <code>txt</code> extension.</p>
        <p>Command-line terminals are also usually already installed: on Windows&reg; it's recommended to use PowerShell; on other systems there might be multiple programs available with different names, but looking for a program called &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; or &ldquo;console&rdquo; will usually yield results.</p>
        <p>More complex tools, like integrated development environments (IDE), can also provide their own built-in command-line terminal.</p>

      <section class="compiling">
        <h2 id="compiling">Compiling an awa5x program</h2>

        <p>Create a folder for your programs. For example, it can be <code>C:\Users\MyUser\Desktop\awa5-programs</code> or <code>/home/myuser/awa5-programs</code>, just make sure you can reach it through its full path.</p>
        <p>Inside your text editor, type the following (you can copy and paste it):</p>
        <pre>awa
awa awawa awawa awa awawawawawawawa
awa awawa awawa awa awa awa awa awa awa awa awa
awa awawa awawa awa awa awa awa awa awa awawa
awa awawa awawa awa awa awa awa awa awa awa awa
awawa awa awawa awa awa awa awa awawa awa awa
awa awa awa awawa</pre>

        <p>Save this file inside the folder you just created. The name is not important, but for simplicity let's call it <i>myprogram.txt</i>.</p>
        <p>Open your terminal and navigate inside the folder with your awa5x tools. Let's say it's on your desktop, so you can enter it for example with the command:</p>
        <pre>cd C:\Users\MyUser\Desktop\awa5x</pre>
        <p>or</p>
        <pre>cd /home/myuser/Desktop/awa5x</pre>
        <p>according to your system.</p>

        <p>Now, compile the program by executing the compiler tool:</p>
        <pre>./awa5c C:\Users\MyUser\Desktop\awa5-programs\myprogram.txt > C:\Users\MyUser\Desktop\awa5-programs\myprogram.awa</pre>
        <p>Make sure you give the proper paths to your file.</p>
        <p>The name of <i>myprogram.awa</i> is once again not important, you are free to change it to anything you want.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="execution">
        <h2 id="execution">Executing the compiled program</h2>

        <p>Ensure the <i>myprogram.awa</i> file exists and its size is not zero bytes. You might want to check that you did everything correctly before moving on.</p>
        <p>Now run this command in your terminal:</p>
        <pre>./awa5 C:\Users\MyUser\Desktop\awa5-programs\myprogram.awa</pre>
        <p>You should see the text <code>AWA</code> printed below the command you just executed.</p>
